%  TODO conclusion

  \section{Contribution}

%   TODO why is this useful at all

   Converting \ppt presentations into \mxp is now possible and easy.

   Automated layout has not been available in presentations until now. \mxp is
   the first presentation system that doesn't require predefined templates, nor
   manual layout tweaking by the enduser, instead letting people focus on the
   content while the software takes care of the rest.

  \section{Future Work}

%   TODO what should the next thesis slave still fix

   Other formats: extend the convertor tool to convert Keynote, prezzi, pptx,
   \ldots

   Integrate the convertor into an \mxp editor

   Improve the automated layout algorithm beyond constraints using learning AI,
   training it on good/bad layouts, neural network...

   Implement extreme zooming into \mxp using the CSS3 perspective property
   along with translation along the z-axis to utilize the full power of the 3d
   space.
