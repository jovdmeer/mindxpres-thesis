  \section{\ppt}

   \ppt was officially released in 1990, with Windows 3.0 \citep{austin-1}. It
   had originally been developed as Presenter, but trademark issues caused a
   name change early on. It was also originally build for the Macintosh, which
   may seem surprising nowadays but was actually common practice back then
   since the Macintosh was widely regarded as a better development environment,
   more mature, more stable and capable of far better performance and
   visualisations. Some may argue this still rings true today.

   Since then, it has grown to be the world's most popular slide show
   presentation program, alledgedly having been installed on over 1 billion
   computers worldwide, and being used on average 350 times \emph{per second}
   \citep{parks-1}. In 2012, it had a market share of 95\%, leaving the other
   5\% to be shared by alternatives such as Apple's Keynote, Prezi, SlideRocket
   and others. While this number is declining, it may not be going as fast as
   many people think. As most readers of this thesis have heard before, over 30
   million \ppt presentations are created every day, for all kinds of purposes,
   with good and bad results both presentation-wise and goal-wise.

   TODO this probably needs more content.

   \subsection{Introduction}

% --- BEGIN Reinout's awesome stuff

    The importance of digital presentations in this day and age cannot be
    understated. Millions of presentations are created every day, supporting
    the oral transfer of knowledge and playing an important role in educational
    settings. Their origins as tools for creating physical media such as
    photographic slides or transparencies for overhead projectors are still
    reflected in the underlying concepts and principles of slide-based
    presentation tools. The rectangular boundaries of a slide, and the linear
    navigation between slides, are still restrictions we face today in digital
    presentations. Tufte argues that these concepts of slideware have a
    negative impact on the effectiveness of knowledge transfer \citep{tufte-1}.
    While the presenter is compelled to squeeze complex ideas into a linear
    sequence of slides, those ideas are rarely sequential by nature, resulting
    in a loss of relations, overview and details. An initial approach to
    address these issues might involve creating minimalistic presentations or
    introducing some structure via a table of contents. Sadly, when complex
    knowledge or other pieces of rich information need to be presented “as is”
    \citep{farkas-1} --- as in the domain of learning --- this does not work.

    One of the main issues with traditional slideware presentations is their
    monolithic nature, especially when content is spread over many
    self-contained presentation files. ``Reusing'' previous work involves
    either switching between files while giving a presentation or duplicating
    some slides in the new presentation. It should be noted that this issue is
    not limited to the reuse of single slides: there is an ever increasing
    wealth of resources available for reuse, spread over a wide spectrum of
    distribution channels and formats. The possibility to include content by
    reference or transclusion \citep{nelson-1} may contribute in crossing the
    boundaries between different types of media and prove beneficial in the
    context of modern cross-media presentation tools.

%## TODO rework this ##

    There also seems to be an imbalance between the functionality for the
    authoring and visualisation of content. The main authoring views consist of
    toolbars and buttons to specify how content should be visualised while
    there is less support for the authoring of the content itself. While we
    have seen the addition of basic multimedia types such as videos to modern
    slideware, most content is still rather static. During a presentation we
    can, for example, not easily change from a bar chart to a pie chart data
    visualisation or dynamically change some values to see the immediate
    effect, which could be beneficial for knowledge transfer
    \citep{holzinger-1}. Finally, the audience can be more actively involved
    via audience response and classroom connectivity systems which provide
    multi-device interfaces for sharing knowledge and results during as well as
    after a presentation. The evolution of presentations can be compared with
    the Web 2.0 movements where users have become contributors, content is more
    dynamic and interactive and where we have a decentralisation of content via
    service-oriented architectures.

    The rapid prototyping and evaluation of new concepts for the
    representation, visualisation and interaction with content is essential in
    order to move a step towards the next generation of cross-media
    presentation tools. After introducing existing slideware solutions, we
    discuss the requirements for next generation presentation tools. This is
    followed by a description of the extensible \mxp architecture and its
    plug-in mechanism. The web technology-based implementation of \mxp is
    validated based on a number of use cases and \mxp plug-ins and followed by
    a discussion of future work.

   \subsection{Background}

    The impact, benefits and issues of slideware have been studied ever since
    digital slideware has been introduced. While some studies acknowledge
    slideware as a teaching aid \citep{holzinger-1}, Tufte \citep{tufte-1}
    heavily criticises slideware for sticking to outdated concepts. He
    addresses the many consequences of spatial limitations or linear navigation
    and relates them to the human mind which works differently. One of Tufte's
    conclusions, which is also confirmed by Adams \citep{adams-1}, is that
    slide-based presentations are not suitable for all kinds of knowledge
    transfer and in particular not in scientific settings. Recent work shows
    that it is important for the learning process that content is well
    integrated in the greater whole, both structurally and visually
    \citep{gross-1}, which is influenced by the navigation and visualisation.
    There have been a number of different approaches to offer non-linear
    navigation. Zoomable User Interfaces (ZUIs) as used by CounterPoint
    \citep{good-1}, Fly \citep{lichtschlag-1} or Prezi, offer virtually
    unlimited space. Also Microsoft has experimented with zoomable interfaces
    in pptPlex. While ZUIs are one way to escape the boundaries of the slide,
    we have seen other approaches such as MultiPresenter \citep{lanir-1} or
    tiling slideshows \citep{chen-1}. PaperPoint \citep{signer-1} and Palette
    \citep{nelson-2} further enable the non-linear navigation of digital
    presentations based on a slide selection via augmented paper-based
    interfaces. Finally, there is a category of authoring tools that use
    hypermedia to enable different paths through a set of slides.
    NextSlidePlease \citep{spicer-1} allows users to create a weighted graph of
    slides and may suggest navigational paths based on the link weights and the
    remaining presentation time. Microsoft follows this trend with their
    HyperSlides \citep{edge-1} project. The potential of PowerPoint as an
    authoring tool for hypermedia-based presentations has further been
    investigated by Garcia \citep{garcia-1}.

    Existing presentation tools require content to be duplicated for reuse,
    resulting in multiple redundant copies that need to be kept up to date.
    Even though some attempts have been made to address this issue, there is
    room for improvement. When it comes to document formats for more general
    educational purposes, there are formats such as the Learning Material
    Markup Language (LMML) \citep{suss-1}, the Connexions Markup Language
    (CNXML) and the eLesson Markup Language (eLML) \citep{fisler-1}. The common
    factor of these formats is their focus on the reuse of content, but always
    at a relatively high granularity level. Content is organised in lessons or
    modules and users are encouraged to use these, as a whole, in their
    teaching. When we examined the formats in more detail, we noticed that they
    support outgoing links to external content but not the inclusion of content
    via references (transclusion). In the context of presentations, Microsoft's
    Slide Libraries are central repositories for the storage of slides in order
    to facilitate slide sharing and reuse within a company. However, one needs
    to set up a SharePoint server which might represent a hurdle for some
    users. Slides still need to be searched and manually copied into
    presentations. Furthermore, users are responsible to push back updates to
    the repository or update slides when they have been modified on the server
    side. Other commercial tools with similar intentions and functionality for
    content reuse are SlideRocket or SlideShare. The SliDL \citep{canos-1}
    research framework provides a service-oriented architecture for storing and
    tagging slides in a database for reuse. However, it shares some of the
    shortcomings of Microsoft's Slide Libraries. The ALOCOM \citep{verbert-1}
    framework for flexible content reuse consists of a content ontology and a
    (de)composition framework for legacy documents including PowerPoint
    documents, Wikipedia pages and SCORM content packages. While ALOCOM
    succeeds in the decomposition of legacy documents, it might be too rigid
    for evolving presentation formats and the tool is furthermore only
    supporting the authoring phase.

    There is not only a similarity in the evolution of the Web and presentation
    environments, but a number of the issues presented in this section have
    solutions in the setting of the Web. It is therefore not surprising that
    more recently we see the use of web technologies for realising presentation
    solutions. The Simple Standards-based Slide Show System
    (S5)\footnote{http://meyerweb.com/eric/tools/s5/} is an XHTML-based file
    format for slideshows which enforces the classical slideware model. The
    Slidy \citep{raggett-1} initiative by the W3C introduces another
    presentation format which is based on the standard slideware model. While
    these two formats are too limited for our needs, they have some interesting
    properties. Both formats show a clean separation of content and
    presentation via CSS themes. The visualisation is resolution independent
    and the layout and font size are adapted to the available screen real
    estate. Finally, we would like to mention recent HTML5-based presentation
    solutions, including projects such as impress.js, deck.js, Shower or
    reveal.js. A major benefit of applying a widely used open standard such as
    HTML is the cross-device support. Nevertheless, also these solutions show
    some restrictions in terms of visualisation, navigation and cross-media
    support.

    Most of the tools and projects presented in this section focus on specific
    novel ideas for presentations. However, there is no interoperability
    between the concepts introduced in different tools. While one project might
    focus on the authoring, another one focusses on novel content types and a
    third solution introduces radically new navigation mechanisms. Some
    slideware tools can be extended via third-party plug-ins but the
    functionality that is exposed to the developers is often limited by the
    tool's underlying model. For example, PowerPoint allows plug-ins to
    interact with the presentation model, but the model dictates that a
    presentation must consist of a sequence of slides. This lack of freedom is
    also a shortcoming of existing web-based presentation formats. We therefore
    see a need for an open presentation platform such as \mxp which supports
    innovation by providing the necessary modularity and interoperability
    \citep{bush-1}.

   \subsection{Requirements}

    We now introduce a number of requirements to support a broad range of
    presentation styles and visualisations which have been compiled based on a
    review of the more recent presentation solutions presented in the previous
    section.

     \paragraph{Non-linear Navigation} As outlined earlier, the linear
      traversal of slides is a concept that has been taken over from early
      photographic slides. Nowadays, users are accustomed to this form of
      navigation even if it might come with some disadvantages. Any navigation
      outside of the predefined linear path (e.g. to answer a question from the
      audience) is rather complicated, since the presenter either needs
      substantial time to scroll forwards or backwards to the desired slide or
      has to switch to the slide sorter view. It is further impossible to
      include a single slide multiple times in the navigational path without
      any duplication. There are different ways how this lack of flexible
      navigation can be addressed, including presentation tools that allow the
      presenter to define non-linear navigation paths \citep{spicer-1}
      \citep{edge-1} or zoomable user interfaces (ZUIs) \citep{good-1}
      \citep{lichtschlag-1} \citep{haller-1}.

     \paragraph{Separation of Content and Presentation} In order to facilitate
      experimentation with different visualisations, there should be a clear
      separation between content and presentation. This allows the authors of a
      presentation to focus on the content while the visualisation is handled
      by the presentation tool. Note that this approach is similar to the
      \latex typesetting system where content is written in a standardised
      structured way and the visualisation is automatically handled by the
      typesetting system. There is also a \latex document class for
      presentations called Beamer and we were inspired by its structured and
      content-driven approach. However, the content-related functionality and
      the visualisation are too limited to be considered as a basis for an
      extensible presentation tool.

     \paragraph{Extensibility} In order for a presentation tool to be
      successful as an experimental platform for new presentation concepts, it
      should be easy to rapidly prototype new content types and presentation
      formats as well as innovative navigation and visualisation techniques. It
      has to be possible to add or replace specific components without
      requiring changes in the core. In order to be truly extensible, a
      presentation tool should provide a modular architecture with loosely
      coupled components. Note that this type of extensibility should not only
      be offered on the level of content types but also for the visualisation
      engine or content structures.

     \paragraph{Cross-Media Content Reuse} In the introduction we briefly
      mentioned the lack of content reuse in existing presentation tools. There
      is a wealth of open education material available but it is rather
      difficult to use this content in presentations. On the other hand, the
      concept of transclusion works well for digital documents and parts of the
      Web (e.g. via the HTML img tag). A modern presentation tool should also
      support the seamless integration of external cross-media content. This
      includes various mechanisms for including parts of other presentations
      (e.g. slides), transcluding content from third-party document formats as
      well as including content from open learning repositories.

     \paragraph{Connectivity} With the rise of social and mobile technologies,
      connectivity for multi-device input and output becomes more relevant in
      the context of presentation tools. Support for multi-directional
      connectivity is required for a number of reasons. First, it is necessary
      for the previously mentioned cross-media transclusion from external
      resources. Second, multi-directional connectivity forms the backbone for
      audience feedback via real-time response or voting systems
      \citep{dufresne-1} as well as other forms of multi-device interfaces.

     \paragraph{Interactivity} We mentioned that content might be more
      interactive and the extensibility requirement addresses this issue since
      the targeted architecture should support dynamic or interactive content
      and visualisations. Nevertheless, the use of mouse and keyboard might not
      be sufficient for components offering a high level of interaction.
      Therefore, a presentation tool should enable the integration of other
      forms of input such a gesture-based interaction based on Microsoft's
      Kinect controller or digital pen interaction \citep{signer-2} as offered
      by the PaperPoint \citep{signer-1} presentation tool.

     \paragraph{Post-Presentation Phase} Even if it was never the original goal
      of slide decks, they often play an important role as study or reference
      material. While the sharing of traditional slide decks after a
      presentation is trivial, this changes when the previously mentioned
      requirements are taken into account. For instance, the nonlinear
      navigation allows presenters to go through their content in a non-obvious
      order or input from the audience might drive parts of a presentation.
      Special attention should therefore be paid to the post-presentation
      phase. It should not only be easy to play back a presentation with the
      original navigational path, annotations and audience input, but its
      content should also be made discoverable and reusable. In accordance with
      the Web 2.0, we see potential for the social aspect in a
      post-presentation phase via a content discussion mechanism.

   \subsection{\mxp Platform}
    \label{mxp-platform}

    In this section, we present the general architecture of our
    \mxp\footnote{http://mindxpres.com} crossmedia presentation platform which
    is outlined in \figref{roels-1-fig-1} and addresses the requirements
    presented in the previous section.

    \fig{\mxp architecture}{roels-1-fig-1}

    \subsubsection{Document Format and Authoring Language}

     Content is stored, structured and referenced in a dedicated \mxp document
     format. An individual \mxp document contains the content itself and may
     also refer to some external content to be included. A new \mxp document
     can be written manually similar to the \latex approach introduced earlier
     or in the near future it can also be generated via a graphical authoring
     tool. In contrast to other presentation formats such as Slidy, S5 or
     OOXML, the authoring language eliminates unnecessary HTML and XML
     specifics and focusses on a semantically more meaningful vocabulary. The
     vocabulary of the authoring language is almost completely defined by
     plug-ins that provide support for various media types and structures. In
     order to give users some freedom in the way they present their
     information, the core \mxp presentation engine only plays a supporting
     role for plug-ins and lets them define the media types (e.g. video or
     source code) as well as structures (e.g. slides or graph-based content
     layouts).

     This is also reflected in the document format as each plug-in extends the
     vocabulary that can be used. Any visual styling including different fonts,
     colours or backgrounds is achieved by applying specific themes to the
     underlying content.

    \subsubsection{Compiler}

     The compiler transforms a \mxp document into a self-contained portable
     \mxp presentation bundle. While a \mxp document could be directly interpreted
     at visualisation time, for a number of reasons we decided to have this
     intermediary step. First, the compiler allows different types of presentations
     to be created from the same \mxp document instance. This means that we can not
     only create dynamic and interactive presentations but also more static output
     formats such as PDF documents for printing. Similarly, we cannot always expect
     that there will be an Internet connection while giving a presentation. For this
     case, the compiler might create an offline version of a presentation with all
     necessary content pre-downloaded and included in the \mxp presentation bundle.
     Last but not least, the compiler might resolve incompatibility issues by, for
     instance, converting unsupported video formats.

    \subsubsection{\mxp Presentation Bundle}

     The dynamic \mxp presentation bundle consists of the compiled content
     together with a portable cross-platform presentation runtime engine which
     allows more interactive and networked presentations. Similar to the original
     document, the compiled presentation content still consists of both, integrated
     content and references to external resources such as online content that will
     be retrieved when the presentation is visualised. Note that the content might
     have been modified by the compiler and, for example, been converted or
     extracted from other document formats that the runtime engine cannot process.
     References to external content may have been dereferenced by the compiler for
     offline viewing.

     A presentation bundle's core runtime engine consists of the three modules
     shown in \figref{roels-1-fig-1}. The \emph{content engine} is responsible
     for processing the content and linking it to the corresponding
     visualisation plug-ins. The \emph{graphics engine} abstracts all
     rendering-related functionality. For instance, certain presenters prefer a
     zoomable user interface in order to provide a better overview of their
     content \citep{reuss-1}. This graphical functionality is also exposed to
     the plug-ins, which can make use of the provided abstractions. The
     \emph{communication engine} exposes a communication API that can be used
     by plug-ins. It provides some basic functionality for fetching external
     content but also offers the possibility to form networks between multiple
     \mxp presentation instances as well as to connect to third-party hardware
     such as digital pens or clicker systems.

     In addition to the presentation content and core modules, the presentation
     bundle contains a set of \emph{themes} and \emph{plug-ins} that are referenced
     by the content. Themes may contain visual styling on a global as well as on a
     plug-in level. When the content engine encounters different content types, they
     are handed over to the specific plug-in which uses the graphics engine to
     visualise the content.

    \subsubsection{Plug-in Types}

     \fig{Structure plug-in examples}{roels-1-fig-2}

     In order to provide the necessary flexibility, all non-core modules are
     implemented as plug-ins. Even the basic content types such as text, images or
     bullet lists have been realised via plug-ins and three major categories of
     plug-ins have to be distinguished:

     \begin{itemize}

      \item \emph{Components} form the basic building blocks of a presentation.
      They are represented by plug-ins that handle the visualisation for specific
      content types such as text, images, bullet lists, graphs or videos. The content
      engine invokes the corresponding plug-ins in order to visualise the content.

      \item \emph{Containers} are responsible for grouping and organising
      components of a specific type. An example of such a container is a slide with
      each slide containing different content but also some reoccurring elements.
      Every slide of a presentation may for example contain elements such as a title,
      a slide number and the author's name, which can be abstracted in a higher level
      container. Another example is an image container that visualises its content as
      a horizontally scrollable list of images. Note that we are not restricted to
      the slide format and content can be laid out in alternative ways.

      \item \emph{Structures} are high-level structures and layouts for
      components and containers. For example, content can be scattered in a
      graph-like structure or it can be clearly grouped in sections like in a book.
      Both are radically different ways of visualising and navigating content but by
      abstracting them as plug-ins, the user can easily switch between different
      presentation styles as the ones shown in \figref{roels-1-fig-2}. Structures differ
      from containers by the fact that they do not impose restrictions on the media
      types of their child elements and may also influence the default navigational
      path through the content.

     \end{itemize}

   \subsection{Implementation}

    We have chosen HTML5 and its related web technologies as the backbone for
    our \mxp presentation platform. Other options such as JavaFX, Flash or game
    engines have also been investigated, but HTML5 seemed to be the best choice.
    The widely accepted HTML5 standard makes \mxp presentations highly portable and
    runnable on any device with a recent web browser, including smartphones and
    tablets. Furthermore, HTML5 provides rich visualisation functionality out of
    the box and the combination with Cascading Style Sheets
    (CSS) and third-party JavaScript libraries forms a potent visualisation
    platform.

    \subsubsection{Document Format and Authoring Language}

     The \mxp document format which allows us to easily express a
     presentation's content, structure and references is based on the
     eXtensible Markup Language (XML). A simple example of a presentation
     defined in our XML-based authoring language is shown in \lstref{xml-1}.
     The set of valid tags and their structure, except the \code{presentation}
     root tag, is defined by the available plug-ins.

     \begin{figure}[h!]
      \begin{lstxml}{xml-1}{Authoring a simple \mxp presentation}
<presentation>
  <slide title="Vannevar Bush">
    <bulletlist>
      <item>March 11, 1890 - June 28, 1974</item>
      <item>American Engineer, founder of Raytheon</item>
    </bulletlist>
    <image source="bush.jpg"/>
  </slide>
</presentation>
      \end{lstxml}
     \end{figure}

    \subsubsection{Compiler}

     The compiler has been realised as a Node.js application. This not only
     allows the compiler to be used via a web interface or as a web service,
     but projects such as node-webkit also enable the compiler to run as a
     local offline desktop application. The choice of using server-side
     JavaScript was influenced by the fact that Node.js is capable of bridging
     web and desktop technologies. On the one hand, the framework makes it easy
     to interact with other web services and to work with HTML, JSON, XML and
     JavaScript visualisation libraries at compile time. On the other hand, the
     framework can also perform tasks which are usually not suited for web
     technologies, including video conversion, legacy document format access,
     file system access or TCP/IP connectivity.

     In order to validate a \mxp document in the XML format described above,
     there is an XML Schema which is augmented with additional constraints
     provided by the plug-ins. After validation, the document is parsed and
     discovered tags might trigger preprocessor actions by the plug-ins such as
     the extraction of data from referenced legacy document formats (e.g.
     PowerPoint or Excel) or the conversion of an unsupported video format. The
     tag is then converted to HTML5 by simply encoding the information in the
     attributes of a \code{div} element. The HTML5 standard allows custom
     attributes if they start with a \code{data-} prefix. \lstref{xml-2} shows
     parts of the transformed XML document shown in \lstref{xml-1}. Note that
     the transformation does not include visualisation-specific information but
     merely results in a valid HTML5 document which is bundled into a
     self-contained package together with the presentation engine.

     \begin{figure}[h!]
      \begin{lstxml}{xml-2}{Transformed HTML5 presentation content}
<div data-type="presentation">
  <div data-type="slide" data-title="Vannevar Bush">
    <div data-type="bulletlist">
      ...
      \end{lstxml}
     \end{figure}

    \subsubsection{Presentation Engine}

     The presentation engine's task is to turn the compiled HTML content into a
     visually appealing and interactive presentation. As highlighted in
     \figref{roels-1-fig-1}, the presentation engine consists of several
     smaller components which help plug-ins to implement powerful features with
     minimal effort. The combination of these components enables the rapid
     prototyping and evaluation of innovative visualisation ideas. A resulting
     \mxp presentation combining various structure, container and component
     plug-ins is shown in \figref{roels-1-fig-3}.

     \fig{A \mxp presentation}{roels-1-fig-3}

     \paragraph{Content Engine} When a presentation is loaded, the content
      engine is the first component that is activated. It processes the content
      of the HTML presentation by making use of the well-known jQuery
      JavaScript library. Whenever a \code{div} element is discovered, the
      \code{data-type} attribute is read and the corresponding plug-ins are
      notified in order to visualise the content.

     \paragraph{Graphics Engine} The graphics engine provides support for
      interesting new visualisation and navigation styles. Next to some basic
      helper functions, it offers efficient panning, scaling and rotation via
      CCS3 transformations and supports zoomable user interfaces as well as the
      more traditional navigation approaches.

     \paragraph{Communication Engine} The communication engine implements
      abstractions that allow plug-ins to retrieve external content at run
      time. It further provides the architectural foundation to form networks
      between different \mxp instances or to integrate third-party hardware
      \citep{roels-2}. For our \mxp prototype, we used a small Intel Next Unit
      of Computing Kit (NUC) with high-end WiFi and Bluetooth modules to act as
      a central access point and provide the underlying network support. \mxp
      instances use WebSockets to communicate with other \mxp instances via the
      access point. The access point further acts as a container for data
      adapters which translate input from third-party input and output devices
      into a generic representation that can be used by the \mxp instances in
      the network. In order to go beyond simple broadcast-based communication,
      we have implemented a routing mechanism based on the publish-subscribe
      pattern where plug-ins can subscribe to specific events or publish
      information. The communication engine provides the basis for audience
      response systems \citep{roels-2} or even full classroom communication
      systems where functionality is only limited by the creativity of plug-in
      developers.

     \paragraph{Plug-ins} Plug-ins are implemented as JavaScript bundles which
      consist of a folder containing JavaScript files and other resources such
      as CSS files, images or other JavaScript libraries. As a first
      convention, a plug-in should provide a manifest file with a predefined
      name. The manifest provides metadata such as the plug-in name and version
      but also a list of tags to be used in a presentation. The plug-in claims
      unique ownership for these tags and is in charge for their visualisation
      if they are encountered by the content engine. As a second convention, a
      plug-in must provide at least one JavaScript file implementing certain
      methods, one of them being the \code{init()} method which is called when
      the plug-in is loaded by the presentation engine. It is up to the plug-in
      to load additional JavaScript or CSS via the provided dependency
      injection functionality. A second method to be implemented is the
      \code{visualise()} method which is invoked with a pointer to the
      corresponding DOM node as a parameter when the content engine encounters
      a tag to be visualised. A plug-in is free to modify the DOM tree and may
      also register callbacks to handle future interaction with the content.

     \paragraph{Themes} We currently use CSS to provide a basic templating
      system. These themes offer styling either on a global or on a plug-in
      level. However, we see this as a temporary solution as it is not
      well-suited for alternative compiler outputs (e.g. PDF) and a more
      generic templating scheme is planned for the future.

   \subsection{Use Cases}

    In order to validate the architectural and technological choices, we
    demonstrate the extensibility and feasibility of \mxp as a rapid
    prototyping platform by presenting a number of content- and
    navigation-specific plug-ins that have been developed so far. Additional
    plug-ins for audience-driven functionality such as real-time polls, screen
    mirroring and navigational takeover can be found in \citep{roels-2}.

    \subsubsection{Structured Overview Plug-in}

     In Section \ref{mxp-platform} we have explained how structure plug-ins may
     change the way presentations are visualised and navigated. In order to
     illustrate this, we have implemented a structure plug-in called
     \emph{structured layout} which combines a zoomable user interface with the
     ability to group content into sections. The resulting visualisation of the
     \emph{structured layout} plug-in is shown in \figref{roels-1-fig-3}.
     Whenever a new section is reached, the view is zoomed out to provide an
     overview of the content within the section and communicate a sense of
     progress.

    \subsubsection{Slide Plug-in}

     In order to also support the traditional slide concept, we created a
     slide-like container plug-in. While the benefits and issues of using
     slides with a fixed size are debatable, we implemented this plug-in as a
     proof of the framework's versatility. The main function of the slide
     plug-in is to provide a rectangular styleable component container with a
     title and some other information. Containers may also offer functionality
     to layout their content. In this case, the slide plug-in offers a quick
     and easy layout mechanism which allows the presenter to partition the
     slide into rows and columns. Content is then assigned to these slots in
     the order that it is discovered. The use of the slide plug-in together
     with the resulting visualisation is exemplified in \figref{roels-1-fig-4}. It
     also shows the use of the image plug-in (a component plug-in) which
     enables a simple form of cross-media transclusion. A visualised external
     image can be cropped and filters (e.g. colour correction) may be applied
     without duplicating or modifying the original source.

     \fig{Slide plug-in}{roels-1-fig-4}

    \subsubsection{Enhanced Video Plug-in}

     When videos are used in educational settings, we often need more
     functionality than what is offered by the average video player
     \citep{reuss-1}. \mxp provides the enhanced video plug-in shown in
     \figref{roels-1-fig-5} with the possibility to overlay a video with text or
     arbitrary shapes. This overlay functionality can be used as a basic
     captioning system as well as to highlight items of interest during
     playback.

     Furthermore, we added the option to trigger certain events at specified
     times. One can define that a video should automatically pause at a certain
     point, highlight an object and continue playing after a specified amount
     of time. Additional features include the bookmarking of certain positions
     in a video for direct access or the possibility to display multiple videos
     in a synchronised manner. Our enhanced video plug-in injects the default
     HTML5 video player and overlays it with a transparent \code{div} element
     for augmentation. Currently we make use of the HTML5 video API to
     synchronise the creation and removal of overlays but a SMIL-based
     implementation might be used in the future.

    \subsubsection{Source Code Visualisation Plug-in}

     Earlier, we mentioned the difficulty of visualising complex resources such
     as source code. Our \mxp source code plug-in exports a \code{code} tag
     which allows the presenter to paste their code into a presentation and
     have \mxp visualise it nicely by making use of syntax highlighting via the
     SyntaxHighlighter\footnote{http://alexgorbatchev.com/SyntaxHighlighter/}
     JavaScript library. Whenever the content engine encounters a \code{code}
     tag, it invokes the code plug-in to beautify the code and automatically
     adds vertical scrollbars for larger pieces of source code as shown in
     \figref{roels-1-fig-6}.

   \subsection{Discussion and Future Work}

    \mxp currently supports transclusion and cross-media content reuse on the
    plug-in level. For instance, the image or video plug-in can visualise (and
    enhance) external resources, a dictionary plug-in might retrieve
    definitions on demand via a web service or we might create a plug-in that
    allows us to import content (e.g. PowerPoint slides) from legacy documents
    at compile time. Nevertheless, we are currently investigating the
    introduction of generic reuse tags in our document format which would allow
    the presenter to transclude arbitrary parts of other \mxp presentations.
    While our focus has been on the cross-media aspect of resources that can be
    used in a presentation, we might also investigate the cross-media
    publishing aspect via alternative compiler output formats.

    We are aware that the current authoring of \mxp presentations has some
    usability issues. The average presenter cannot be expected to construct an
    XML document or any CSS themes. In order to tackle this issue and further
    evaluate \mxp in real-life settings, we are currently developing a
    graphical \mxp authoring tool. We further intend to provide a central
    plug-in repository which would make it easy for novice users to find,
    install and use new plug-ins via the authoring tool. In the long run, we
    intend to revise the use of monolithic documents and move towards
    repositories of semantically linked information based on the RSL hypermedia
    metamodel \citep{signer-3}. This would not only promote content reuse and
    sharing, but also create opportunities for context-aware as well as
    semi-automatic presentation authoring where relevant content is recommended
    by the authoring tool.

   \subsection{Conclusion}

    We have presented \mxp, an HTML5 and web technology-based presentation
    platform addressing the lacking extensibility of existing slideware
    solutions. The extensibility of the \mxp platform heavily relies on a
    plug-in mechanism and we have outlined how the tool can be extended on the
    content, visualisation as well as on the interaction level. By providing
    different forms of cross-media content transclusion, our solution further
    avoids the redundant storage and replication of slides. The presented \mxp
    document format in combination with a compiler and the corresponding
    plug-ins offers the opportunity to have compile- or run-time cross-media
    content transclusion from third-party resources. At the same time, the
    flexible and extensible document model in combination with a zoomable user
    interface allows us to escape the boundaries of traditional slide formats.
    The presented \mxp solution represents a promising platform for the
    unification of existing presentation concepts as well as for the rapid
    prototyping and investigation of new ideas for next generation cross-media
    presentation solutions.

    \mxp tries to be an alternative unlike other alternatives, stepping away
    from the classic slide format and introducing a plugin system to allow
    literally anything you can think of. The obvious choices are
    visualisations, animations, layout and the embedding of various media such
    as video, but it can also provide interaction with the audience, allow
    different presenters to take control from their own device, arbitrarily and
    ad-hoc change the way data is presented allowing to play into the
    audience's reactions unhindered by design decisions made beforehand, and so
    many other novel ways of presenting that captivate the audience instead of
    lulling them to sleep.

    \mxp was first created by my advisor, Reinout Roels, in 2012 as part of his
    Master thesis, and has since been built upon by himself and other students.
