%%% TODO thank people

%  First of all, I'd like to thank my fianc\'ee, Tania, for her love, for her
%  support, and for her patience. This thesis has been the last hurdle of a race
%  I've been running for way too long, for which I've had to put both of our
%  lives on hold way too often. It's been stressful, and I'm sure she's looking
%  forward to the load being lifted as much as I am.

%  02:25 <reinout> "and I would like to expres my hatred towards my supervisor reinout roels for dragging me along for the worst 20km of my life"
%  Reinout, my advisor and friend, deserves my eternal gratitude for giving me
%  the chance to get this over with, and dragging me through it as well. I
%  could never have finished this without his help, his guidance and his
%  enthousiasm.

%  This section would not be complete without mentioning Peter, my brother, who
%  showed me the fun side of studying, the more significant parts of life, and
%  the importance of procrastination. I'm always proud to call myself his big
%  brother.

%  This thesis was further brought to you with the support of many other people,
%  all of whom really deserve more than just being mentioned in my
%  acknowledgements section, and if they ever need any help they'll know to find
%  me:
%  \begin{itemize}
%   \item My friends, for frequently providing the necessary distraction from this awful ordeal, as well as for giving me many more fun distractions to look forward to whenever there seemed to be no end to this.
%   \item My grandparents, for the moral and financial support which gave me the opportunity to start and finish this, even though I wanted to give up ages ago.
%   \item My parents, for the genes, the upbringing and the moral support, even if they often have no clue what I'm talking about.
%   \item Infected Mushroom, for providing the soundtrack to many late-night caffeine-fueled hack- and write sessions.
%   \item RedBull and Nalu, for providing the fuel for those same sessions.
%   \item My colleagues at Roots Software, for putting up with my quirks, but more importantly for showing me the world beyond academics.
%   \item All professors, assistants and other academic personnel at the VUB, for making me realize a long time ago that I never want to be a part of the academic world. Seriously.
%  \end{itemize}
